## Gordian Principles

` $projectname` is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** `how does it demonstrate independence`
* **Privacy.** `how does it demonstrate privacy`
* **Resilience.** `how does it demonstrate resilience`
* **Openness.** `how does it demonstrate openness`

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.
